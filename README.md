SAP Attachments and Comments Demo App ( SAPUI5 )

# Purpose
**A**pplication allows to _upload, download & delete the attachments_ and _posting & deletion of comments_ in SAP.

The idea is to provide the reusable code that directly works with a OData servcie and model, to my fellow developers.

User interface is build using **SAPUI5** which integrates with backend using **OData Service**. 

**SAP Web IDE** is used to develop this application
